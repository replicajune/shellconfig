This repo is hosting various functions, alias and other shell configurations. Some items may come and go as I use them, or not.

TIP: Please make sure you read the content of this repo before using its functions and aliases.

== Setup

This repo needs to be in `~/.shellconfig`:

[bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:replicajune/shellconfig.git ~/.shellconfig
----

Then for your user and root `.bashrc`:

[bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -f "/home/${SUDO_USER-$USER}/.shellconfig/shellconfig.sh" ]; then
  # shellcheck source=/dev/null
  . "/home/${SUDO_USER-$USER}/.shellconfig/shellconfig.sh"
fi
----
